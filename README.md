# pCG

pCG is a single-page web application that I designed as a pet project to teach myself Javascript, responsive web design, and data passing. It looks up characters who have appeared in the Harry Potter series by name. 


## Design

pCG is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. To improve user experience, I added the Typeahead from Twitter to the search box. Typeahead is a front-end library that creates auto-fill suggestions for user input.

The website is powered by the HP-API hosted on Heroku. Due to the limited amount of data on Heroku, only major characters are listed.

pCG is designed so that everything (i.e. API calls) is handled programmatically on page load.
